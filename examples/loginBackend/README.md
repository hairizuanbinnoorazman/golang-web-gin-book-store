# Minimum Golang Backend

This is the minimum golang backend that should be able to work with a react applications.

A few things to note would be the following:

- Requirement to have CORS available for use as we are using a React frontend to operate together with this
- Login/Logout api endpoints
- A in memory storage of maps.

A proper app can be build on this but a better app structure would be better to get it working properly
